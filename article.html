            <p><strong>N.N.A.I. 2.0</strong> has evolved to make surgeries <strong>easier and safer</strong> 
            for doctors to perform them.</p>

            <p>Over <strong>7000+ hospitals and surgery machines</strong> has equipped our last generation of Artifical Intelligence to
                perform complex surgeries that would guaranteed over <strong>80% success rate of surviving</strong>, and our latest 
                technology would not dissappoint either. 
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>N.N.A.I. 2.0</strong> has set to guarantee over <strong>95% success rate</strong> on completing complex surgeries such as
                heart and eye surgery, while also completing surgeries up to <strong>1.5x faster</strong> 
                than our older generation of AI technology, <strong>plus</strong>; 
            </p>

            <p><strong>N.N.A.I 2.0</strong> has the <strong>capablity</strong> to perform minor surgeries 
                without operating them, by placing them into robotic surgeons. </p>

            <p>
                Our technology will be used in AI Hardware such as <strong>Da Vinci</strong> and <strong>Heartlander</strong> 
                for surgeries when it's released.
